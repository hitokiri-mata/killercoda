 # Port mapping 

By default, when you create or run a container using docker create or docker run, it does not publish any of its ports to the outside world. To make a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the containerâ€™s network, use the `-p` flag. This will create a firewall rule which maps a container port to a port on the Docker host to the outside world. 

Execute the following command to create a container named "c0", where the `-p` option will map the port 80 in the nginx container to the host port 20080.

> `docker run --name c0 -p 20080:80 nginx:1.21`{{execute T1}}

In terminal T2, check the status of the running nginx container.

> `docker ps`{{execute}}

To verify the port mapping status, check that the `PORTS` column for the nginx container is `0.0.0.0:20080->80/tcp`. 

In terminal T2, visit localhost at port 20080 to access the default website in Nginx.

> `curl localhost:20080`{{execute T2}}

Sample output:

```
$ curl localhost:20080
