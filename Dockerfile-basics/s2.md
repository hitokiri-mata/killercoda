# CMD vs. ENTRYPOINT

Modify the "DockerFile" as follows.

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt update 
RUN apt install figlet

# ENTRYPOINT specifies a command that will ALWAYS be executed when the container starts.
ENTRYPOINT ["figlet"]

# CMD specifies arguments that will be fed to the ENTRYPOINT
CMD ["Hello"]

</pre>

Wait until the above updates are saved. 

Build the docker image:

> `docker build -t myimage .`{{execute}}

Sample output from the Docker daemon:

```
$ docker build -t myimage .

```

From the above output, the docker build process will go through the same five steps as before, but the step 2 and step 3 are using cache as we had already built some of these layers in our earlier image builds.  Since nothing had changed in these layers, Docker can simply use a cached version of the layer rather than pulling down code a second time and running those steps. 


The following command will execute `figlet hello` in the container.  Execute:

> `docker run myimage`{{execute}}

If arguments are provided after the image name, the specified argument will be fed to the ENTRYPOINT instead. 

The following command will execute `figlet Hello Docker!` in the container.

> `docker run myimage "Hello Docker!"`{{execute}}
