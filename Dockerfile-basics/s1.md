# Overview of Dockerfile
Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands, in order, needed to build a given image. 

Create a file named "DockerFile" as follows:

<pre class="file" data-filename="Dockerfile" data-target="replace">
# Use the latest debian linux image as a parent image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# install figma using the apt package manager
RUN apt update 
RUN apt install figlet

# Run the command figlet "hello" when the container is launched
CMD ["figlet", "Hello"]
</pre>

About the Dockerfile instructions:
* **FROM:** specifies the base image to use as the starting point for this new image you're creatin
* **RUN:** lets you execute commands inside  your Docker image. The command executs once at build time and get written into your Docker image as a new layer.
* **CMD:** lets you define a default command to run when your container starts. E.g. start your web applicationâ€™s app server when the image is run (only one CMD command in the DockerFile).

You may visit the Dockerfile reference page at https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder to understand more about the various commands for Dockerfiles.

Wait until the above updates are saved.
